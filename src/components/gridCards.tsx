              Effortless Insights: Your Guide to Creating LLM-Based AI for
              Advanced Database Queries and Analysis

              In the ever-evolving landscape of data analysis, a challenge often
              lies in translating complex data queries into clear, actionable
              insights. Consider a scenario where a business needs to understand
              how a particular subset of users are interacting with one of their
              products. Traditionally, this would involve navigating through
              intricate database schemas and writing detailed SQL queries â€” a
              daunting task for many product-oriented professionals, and thus a
              dependency is created on the data teams.
