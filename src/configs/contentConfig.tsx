Consider a scenario where a business needs to understand how a particular subset of users are interacting with one of their products. Traditionally, this would involve navigating through intricate database schemas and writing detailed SQL queries â€” a daunting task for many product-oriented professionals, and thus a dependency is created on the data teams.",
